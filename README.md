The M4 Motorway is a 50.2-kilometer partially tolled dual carriageway (two roadways with opposite directions) that runs through Sydney, New South Wales, Australia. It comprises of the M4 Western Motorway, the M4 East, and the M4–M5 Link (in the future, the M4–M8 Link).

### Interesting facts

**M4 Western Motorway:** In each direction, the M4 Western Motorway is generally three or four lanes wide. During the years 1998 to 2000, it was extended to six lanes, however this did little to alleviate traffic congestion. 

**M4 East:** starts at Haberfield (east), ends at Homebush (west). Opened on 13th of July in 2019, owned by WestConnex, and run by Sydney Motorway Corporation. According to the WestConnex's website,toll for full length will be capped at a maximum amount of $10.47 (2022).

**M4–M5 Link** The M4-M5 Link Tunnels project cost $16.8 billion and employed 9000 workers. It will ideally relieve heavy truck traffic on surface-level highways, allowing industrial workers and truck-driving professionals to move between workplaces and homes more quickly, while their absence on the surface-level roads reduces traffic accidents.
